RMIT student project: Epistasis text mining

## General overview

**Project title:**  

Text mining of scientific articles to create an epistasis database 

**Project description:** 

The number of scientific publications has been increasing exponentially over the past years. Humans can barely keep up with the novel publications; therefore, computer assisted tools to mine all the information available are on the rise. Currently there are existing tools that mine how genes affect diseases however the potential interactions are oftentimes overlooked. The goal for this project is to create a tool that finds genetic interactions found in the literature. 

 

**Ideal outcome:** 

A functioning tool that is able to parse abstracts in PubMed (scientific website) and mine genetic interactions. 
 
**Technical skills?** 

Basic python, ML, and data science skills. But a team member should have some experience with language models or be willing to put the required effort. Optional: Some database management skills, could be replaced by pandas skills.
